This is a Chrome extension that makes a list of websites
more usable. Or usable at all. Your choice.

Many websites are absolutely unusable because of poor
designer choices, ridiculous marketing decisions,
inability to deal with dark mode and the like. This
extension takes a site-per-site approach to fixing this,
so it will never fix the entire web or even a significant
portion of it, but with time and effort it will make your
(well, anyone who develops the extension) use of the web
a lot better because it will more or less end up fixing
all the sites you use semi-regularly.

Some uses of this extension include removing obnoxious
videos playing above the content, annoying modal dialogs
blocking the content or scrolling, slow to display ads
that have the content jump up and down all the time as
you try to click on it, remove banners that take three
quarters of the screen, correct colors when the text is
the same color as the background, etc.
